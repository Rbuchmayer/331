Problem 6.

(a) The testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test fails because the code 
throws an IllegalArgumentException for an input it shouldn't. An 
IllegalArgumentException exception should only be thrown when given 
a negative input. The code threw an IllegalArgumentException for the 
input 0 (a non-negative), so the test did not pass. To fix this, I 
changed the condition that throws the exception from "n <= 0" to
"n < 0", so it only throws exceptions for negative inputs.

(b) The testBaseCase test fails because when given the base case input
0, the code does not return the correct value (1), instead it throws
an IllegalArgumentException that says "0 is negative". Again, this is
because when given 0, the code enters the wrong branch. My fix in
part (a) also fixed this issue because it allows the input 0 to avoid
the branch for negative numbers. 

(c) The testInductiveCase test fails when given the input 2. It 
returns 1 when it should return 2. This is because the base case 
conditional accepts 0, 1, and 2 as base cases, when only 0 and 1 are
the base cases. To fix this I changed the base case conditional from 
"n <= 2" to "n <= 1".

	This allows the input 2 to avoid the base case branch, but the test
still fails. This time, the code returned 0 when it should return 2. 
That made me realize that the return statement subtracts the two 
recursive calls instead of adding them. So to fix this, I changed 
the "-" to a "+" between the two recursive calls in the return 
statement.


Problem 7. 

The Ball object fails the test because it always returns 0 for the 
volume. To fix this I changed it to "return this.volume". 
In addition, when creating a Ball, the volume field of "this" is 
never set to the volume parameter. To fix this, I changed the 
constructor body to be "this.volume = volume".

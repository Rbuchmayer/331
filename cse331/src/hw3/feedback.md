**Problem 3 - HolaWorld:** 5/5

**Problem 4 - RandomHello:** 9/10

- You should use `nextInt(greets.length)` instead of `nextInt(5)`. This is because if this code is modified later to add more greetings, there would be one less line in the code that must be modified. (-1 point)

**Problem 5 - Testing (Fibonacci) Java Code with JUnit :** 5/5

**Problem 6 - Answering Questions about the (Fibonacci) Code:** 15/15

- Question 1: 5/5
- Question 2: 5/5

**Problem 7 - Implementation:** 65/65

- Ball.java: 5/5
- BallContainer.java: 25/25
  - The contents Set already keeps track of the size, so you should not need to manually keep track of the size yourself. (Will be deducting points in future assignments)

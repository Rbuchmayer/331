Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from HW5 and why 
those changes were made below.  (See the HW6 assignment for details.)

I completely got rid of my Node class because it slowed down my implementation
when searching for a Node in the graph. My Node object only had one string field,
so it was better to just use a String to represent a Node instead of having a Node
object. I also added a getNode() method to my graph to find Marvel characters. I 
also had to change my tests to allow these changes.

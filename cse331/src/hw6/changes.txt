Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from HW5 and why 
those changes were made below.  (See the HW6 assignment for details.)

I completely got rid of my Node class because it slowed down my implementation
when searching for a Node in the graph (it took about 2 minutes to build a Graph). Instead,
I used a single String to represent a Node so I could just use the contains() method when 
searching for a Node instead of traversing through the entire Graph looking for an object. 
My Node object only had one string field, so it was better to just use a String to 
represent a Node instead of having a Node object. I also had to change my tests to allow 
these changes.
